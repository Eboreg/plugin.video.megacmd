# plugin.video.megacmd

Mega (stylized in uppercase as MEGA) is a cloud storage and file hosting service offered by Mega Limited, an
Auckland-based company.

This is a very minimal addon to stream videos from your MEGA account.

You need to have MEGAcmd command-line tool installed (from https://mega.nz/cmd) and must have logged into
your account via MEGAcmd before using this addon. This addon parses output from the then available
`megacmd` command which allows for streaming media much faster than logging into MEGA via the addon itself
and decrypting the files manually.

This addon is not affiliated with MEGA or Mega Limited in any way.
